**Non-Statistical Indicator**

The City of Los Angeles is required to adopt an Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) every five years to comply with California’s Urban Water Management Planning Act (Act). The Act is codified in Sections 10610 through 10656 of the California Water Code (CWC). The 2015 UWMP builds upon the goals and progress made in the 2010 UWMP and continues to serve as the City’s master plan for reliable water supply and resources management. The 2015 UWMP is based on a 25 year planning horizon through 2040.
