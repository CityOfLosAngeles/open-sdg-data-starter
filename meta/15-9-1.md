## Relevant Policies

The City of Los Angeles is fortunate to be located within a globally recognized hotspot of native biodiversity. While Los Angeles is a biodiversity jewel, this designation also means that the biodiversity here is threatened, and innovative strategies are needed to ensure its resilience and sustainability. 

In order to protect and enhance Los Angeles's biodiversity, Councilmember Koretz introduced a [Biodiversity Motion](https://www.councilmemberpaulkoretz.com/sites/g/files/wph1761/files/2021-03/Biodiversity%20Motion.pdf) which was unanimously adopted by the Los Angeles City Council on May 10, 2017.

The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation and Environment adapted the [Singapore Index on Cities’ Biodiversity](https://www.cbd.int/subnational/partners-and-initiatives/city-biodiversity-index#:~:text=The%20City%20Biodiversity%20Index%2C%20also,against%20their%20own%20individual%20baselines.) as the first step in implementing the Motion. Los Angeles is the first City in the U.S. to perform this assessment, joining Helsinki, Montreal, Lisbon, and a few other global cities. The Singapore Index assessments are included in [2018 Los Angeles Biodiversity Report](https://www.lacitysan.org/cs/groups/public/documents/document/y250/mdi0/~edisp/cnt024743.pdf) and its [2020 update](https://www.lacitysan.org/san/sandocview?docname=cnt052553).

The LA City Biodiversity Index will be measured every three years, with major milestone measurements at 10-year intervals.
The LASAN Biodiversity Team will perform index measurements with assistance from the Expert Council.
