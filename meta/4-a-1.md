**Non-Statistical Indicator**

## Relevant Policies on School Facilities

Public schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District must comply with the standards set forth by the [Design Standards and Technical Specifications Section](https://www.laschools.org/new-site/asset-management/design-standards). 

The [California Department of Education](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/fa/) also has guidelines and standards for educational facilities in the State of California. The set of guidelines also includes [K-12 Toilet Requirements](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/fa/sf/toiletrequire.asp) by grade level and male/female. 

As these are legal requirements in the State of California and the Los Angeles School District, it is assumed the proportion of schools meeting the indicator requirements for these parts of the indicator would be at, or very close to 100%.
