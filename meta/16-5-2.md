**Non-Statistical Indicator**

In 2018, there were less than 214 cases of bribery reported to the [U.S. Sentencing Commission](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Bribery_FY18.pdf) across the entire country and a total of 13 federal public corruption convictions in Central California. With over 244,000 businesses in Los Angeles County, even if all 214 nationwide bribery cases were briberies attempted by businesses in Los Angeles County, that would still only account for less than 0.08% of businesses.
