**Non-Statistical Indicator**

**Water Supply**
The Los Angeles Aqueducts, local groundwater, and supplemental water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) are the [primary sources of water supply](https://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/faces/ladwp/aboutus/a-water/a-w-sourcesofsupply?_adf.ctrl-state=rl49xxjl2_71&_afrLoop=390821859248607) for the City of Los Angeles (City). The water from the MWD is delivered through the Colorado River Aqueduct and the State Water Project’s California Aqueduct. The LADWP [Urban Water Management Plan](https://www.ladwp.com/cs/groups/ladwp/documents/pdf/mdaw/nzyy/~edisp/opladwpccb762836.pdf) (UWMP) serves as the Water System’s primary resource planning document for achieving compliance with the requirements of California’s Urban Water Management Planning Act.

**Local Watersheds**
There are five watersheds in Los Angeles: Ballona Creek, Dominguez Channel, Marina Del Rey, Santa Monica Bay, and Upper Los Angeles River. Each of the five watersheds has a a Watershed Management Group that meets on a regular basis to develop an [Enhanced Watershed Management Plan](https://www.lacitysan.org/san/faces/home/portal/s-lsh-wwd/s-lsh-wwd-wp/s-lsh-wwd-wp-ewmp?_afrLoop=10496034447815350&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=c8ipmouxn&_adf.ctrl-state=75wbrlfe7_78#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dc8ipmouxn%26_afrLoop%3D10496034447815350%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D75wbrlfe7_82) (EWMP) for their specific watershed.
