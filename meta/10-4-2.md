  The Redistributive Impact of Fiscal Policy indicator is defined as the Gini
  coefficient of prefiscal per capita (or equivalized) income less the Gini
  coefficient of postfiscal per capita (or equivalized) income. The Gini index
  or Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of distribution. It is often used
  as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income distribution or, less
  commonly, wealth distribution among a population. The coefficient ranges from
  0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 representing perfect equality and 1
  representing perfect inequality.
