  The unemployment rate is a useful measure of the underutilization of the
  labour supply. It reflects the inability of an economy to generate employment
  for those persons who want to work but are not doing so, even though they are
  available for employment and actively seeking work. It is thus seen as an
  indicator of the efficiency and effectiveness of an economy to absorb its
  labour force and of the performance of the labour market. Short-term time
  series of the unemployment rate can be used to signal changes in the business
  cycle; upward movements in the indicator often coincide with recessionary
  periods or in some cases with the beginning of an expansionary period as
  persons previously not in the labour market begin to test conditions through
  an active job search.
