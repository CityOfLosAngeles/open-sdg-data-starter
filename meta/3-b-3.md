## Relevant Policies

At the national level, [four federal agencies](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-01/info-regulatory-burden-federal-agencies.pdf) account for 629 regulatory requirements that health systems, hospitals and post-acute care providers must comply with, yet providers are subject to regulation and oversight from many other sources. These are the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Regulations-and-Guidance), the [Office of Inspector General](https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/), the [Office for Civil Rights](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/laws/index.html), and the Office for the [National Coordination for Health IT](https://www.healthit.gov/). 

The [California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Licensing and Certification Division (L&C)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/LCP/Pages/LandCProgramHome.aspx) is responsible for the licensure, regulation, inspection, and certification of health care facilities and certain health care professionals in California.
