Hospitals in the United States are heavily regulated by various national and state agencies. All hospitals in Los Angeles must abide by these rules. This proxy indicator reports the number of hospitals in Los Angeles, all meeting the necessary standards. 

## Relevant Policies

At the national level, [four federal agencies](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-01/info-regulatory-burden-federal-agencies.pdf) account for 629 regulatory requirements that health systems, hospitals and post-acute care providers must comply with, yet providers are subject to regulation and oversight from many other sources. These are the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Regulations-and-Guidance), the [Office of Inspector General](https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/), the [Office for Civil Rights](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/laws-regulations-guidance/laws/index.html), and the Office for the [National Coordination for Health IT](https://www.healthit.gov/). 

The [California Department of Public Health’s (CDPH) Licensing and Certification Division (L&C)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHCQ/LCP/Pages/LandCProgramHome.aspx) is responsible for the licensure, regulation, inspection, and certification of health care facilities and certain health care professionals in California.
