national_indicator_description: >-
  The Census Bureau determines poverty status by using an official poverty
  measure (OPM) that compares pre-tax cash income against a threshold that is
  set at three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 and adjusted for
  family size. The City of Los Angeles will continue to explore sources on
  percent of population below poverty by city/local standards.
