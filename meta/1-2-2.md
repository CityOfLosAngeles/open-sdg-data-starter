  The Real Cost Measure is a self-sufficiency measure designed by United Ways of
  California. Unlike the official poverty measure which does not account for
  local costs of living, the Real Cost Measure incorporates the costs of
  housing, food, health care, child care, transportation and other basic needs
  for a more accurate measure of financial security. To read the methodology,

**Revised indicator:** All instances of "men and women" is revised to people and all instances of "boys and girls" is revised to "all children". This indicator has been revised for inclusivity from the original text: "Proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions."
