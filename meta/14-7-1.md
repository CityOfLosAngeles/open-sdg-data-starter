**Revised**
Revised from original indicator language:"Sustainable fisheries as a proportion of GDP in small island developing States, least developed countries and all countries"

Local governments do not have jurisdiction over marine areas and therefore cannot pass regulations on sustainable fisheries. In California, the tidelands up to 3 nautical miles from shore are managed by the [California State Lands Commission](https://www.slc.ca.gov/water-boundaries/). The Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone and, Exclusive Economic Zone are regulated by the [federal government](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/us-maritime-limits-and-boundaries.html#general-information). The [Magnuson-Stevens Act](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/magnuson-stevens-fishery-conservation-and-management-act) is the primary law governing marine fisheries management in U.S. federal waters.

An approximation would be the GDP from agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting as a proportion of total regional GDP. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife also reports Final California Commercial Landings by regions.
