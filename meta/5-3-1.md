Los Angeles County and the State of California have no minimum age requirement for marriage. Persons under 18 may get a marriage license with written consent from a parent or legal guardian and permission from a California Superior Court Judge. In 2021, State Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris introduced a bill ([AB 1286](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1286)) requiring counties to report the number of child marriages to the state on a quarterly basis.
