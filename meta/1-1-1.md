**Proxy indicator:**

In the United States, the proportion of population below the international poverty line of $1.90 is extremely low (less than 1% of the total population). In Los Angeles, we report a proxy indicator to measure extreme poverty (proportion of population earning less than 50% of the poverty level). The poverty level is set by the Federal Government each year in accordance to household size. For context, the 2020 poverty level for a household of 4 was $26,200 in annual earnings (50% of the poverty level was $13,100).
