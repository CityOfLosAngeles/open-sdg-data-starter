  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the
  first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of

  early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late
  neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day
  of life.
