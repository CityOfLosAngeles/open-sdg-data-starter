national_indicator_available: Prevalence of underweight among children between 2 and 5 years of age.
national_indicator_description: >-
  While the is no dataset for stunting, underlying health conditions can result
  in children and adolescents being underweight. In addition, underweight can
  indicate malnutrition. Less than 2.3% of children in America are underweight.
  Given that Los Angeles County has lower rates of food insecurity than the
  national average, it is highly likely that the prevalence of underweight in
  Los Angeles County is also lower than the national average.
