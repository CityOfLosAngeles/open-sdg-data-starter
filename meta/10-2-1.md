  This indicator is a measure of relative income poverty at the national level.
  It measures how far individuals are from the median standard of living,
  approximating a measure of social exclusion. Persons living in relative
  poverty often experience many other forms of social and economic disadvantage
  through unemployment, poor housing, inadequate health care and barriers in
  accessing education and economic, social, political and cultural activities,
  which can result from social stigmatisation.

computation_definitions: >-
  Every year, the Census Bureau collects data on how much money households
  obtain from 50 different sources, all of which we label “income.” Earnings,
  primarily wages and salary from a job, are usually a big source of income.
  Other sources of income include Social Security payments, pensions, child
  support, public assistance, annuities, money derived from rental properties,
  interest and dividends. Only full-time, year-round workers with earnings are
  included.
