  To fill the data gap, UN Environment and Google have collaborated with the
  European Commission’s Joint Research Centre and launched this Water-Related
  Ecosystems platform, aiming at providing free and open access to national,
  sub-national, basin and sub-basin aggregated data on water extent.
  Satellite-based Earth observations on this site partially supplement
  countries’ in situ monitoring and nationally reported data. Currently the site
  covers only parts of indicator 6.6.1 components (i.e. change in spatial extent
  of open water bodies) but will include others (e.g. water quantity and
  quality, natural and artificial water bodies, etc.) in the future.
