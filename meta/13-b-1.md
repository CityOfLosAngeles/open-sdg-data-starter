Mayor Eric Garcetti released L.A.'s first [2015 Sustainable City pLAn](https://plan.lamayor.org/background/background_plan.html) in 2015 with a commitment to annual progress reports and a major update to the pLAn every four years. In 2019, the L.A. Green New Deal became the City's new sustainability plan with four key principles: a commitment to the Paris Agreement, a responsibility to deliver environmental justice and equity, a duty to ensure that every Angeleno has the ability to join the green economy, and a resolve to demonstrate the art of the possible and lead the way to drive change. L.A's Green New Deal has [five main targets](https://plan.lamayor.org/targets/targets_plan.html). By 2050, L.A. will have a zero carbon grid, zero carbon transportation, zero carbon buildings, zero waste, and zero wasted water.
