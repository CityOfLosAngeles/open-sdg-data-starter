## Relevant Policies

National immigration policy is an exclusive power of the federal government. However, the Los Angeles Mayor's Office has an Office of Immigrant Affairs with the goal of integrating immigrants into the city’s social, economic, and political fabric. To date, the Office has actively engaged more than 150,000 Angelenos through its work to coordinate city services, develop programs, and initiatives that promote citizenship and civic engagement, and advocate on local, state, and national legislation and policy. 

In March 2017, Mayor Eric Garcetti signed Executive Directive #20 to ensure that L.A.’s public servants stay focused on protecting people, serving communities, and saving lives — not inquiring about immigration status or engaging in federal civil immigration enforcement. 

Mayor Eric Garcetti is also in the Leadership Board of the international Mayor's Migration Council along with the mayors of Freetown, Sao Paulo, Athens, Kampala, Zurich, Montreal, Bristol, Milan, and Amman.
